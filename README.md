# Design Patterns in C#  

Welcome to the Design Patterns in C# repository! This project serves as a companion to my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@mostafa_dindar) where I explore various design patterns in C#. In this repository, you'll find sample code and explanations for each pattern covered in the videos.

## Introduction to Design Patterns  

Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems. They provide a standard terminology and are a way to communicate design ideas effectively. In this repository, we will explore various patterns commonly used in C# development.  

## Design Patterns Covered
I aim to cover the design patterns that are most commonly used in daily development. In this repository, you’ll find examples of the following implemented design patterns

- Singleton  
- Factory Method
- Strategy    
- Abstract Factory  
- Decorator



## Design Patterns On the way  
- Builder  
- Prototype  
- Adapter  
- Bridge  
- Composite  
- Façade  
- Flyweight  
- Proxy  
- Chain of Responsibility  
- Command  
- Interpreter  
- Iterator  
- Mediator  
- Memento  
- Observer  
- State  
- Template Method  
- Visitor  

Each folder corresponds to a specific design pattern and contains code examples along with explanations to help you understand how and when to use them.
