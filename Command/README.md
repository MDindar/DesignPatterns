# Command Design Pattern 
![Uml Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MDindar/DesignPatterns/refs/heads/main/Command/assets/command.png)
# Definition : 
The Command Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern used to turn a request into a stand-alone object that contains all the information about the request. It allows you to parameterize clients with queues, requests, and operations, and it decouples the sender and the receiver of the request. This pattern is particularly useful when you need to manage a series of requests and operations in a clean and flexible way.

# Ideal Scenarios : 

## Undo/Redo Operations:

When you need to implement undo/redo functionality for user actions, the Command pattern is ideal. Each operation can be encapsulated in a command object, and the system can track the command history.
Transactional Operations:

## When you need to support transactions

where commands can be committed or rolled back (like database transactions). The Command pattern allows you to encapsulate each step of the transaction and control its execution.

## Macro Commands:

When you want to execute a sequence of operations as a single command. This is useful for batch processes or automation workflows.

## Queuing Requests:

If you need to queue commands for execution at a later time or asynchronously, the Command pattern can be used to decouple the command invocations from their execution.
GUI Systems with Buttons and Menus:

## In GUI systems
 buttons and menu items often need to execute specific actions. The Command pattern can be used to bind GUI actions to different commands, making the system more modular and maintainable.
Logging Requests:

## When you need to log requests 
(e.g., for debugging, monitoring, or auditing), each request can be turned into a command and logged as itâ€™s executed.
Remote Method Invocation (RMI) and Network Requests:

## In scenarios involving remote or distributed systems
 command objects can be used to encapsulate a request that can be executed on the server, making it easier to handle and manage the network communication.
Dynamic Command Invocation:

## If you want to support dynamic behavior
 where commands can be chosen or composed at runtime based on user input or external conditions.
